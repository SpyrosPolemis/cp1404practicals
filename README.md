# CP1404 Practicals

Hello, I am Spyros, a student who is passionate about programming and cybersecurity. This is my work for CP1404 -
Programming 2. The practicals in this subject aim to teach various concepts such as comprehensions, dictionaries,
exceptions, classes & OOP and more.

## Things learnt:

This subject has taught me various things about clean code, such as:

- Try to avoid having very long functions, instead split up long functions into more, smaller functions.
 - There is no need to make a variable, just to return it, instead, return the expression, e.g.
    

    def my_function(first_var, second_var):
        return first_var + second_var
- Do not use `if var == True:`, instead, you can just use `if var:`
